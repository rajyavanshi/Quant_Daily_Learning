    "A mid-sized quant research firm is building a lightweight diagnostic toolkit to quickly assess whether an asset’s daily returns behave according to classical models (Gaussian) or show heavy-tailed, unstable behaviour.\n",

    "\n",
    "* risk teams (VaR estimation)\n",

    "* trading teams (volatility prediction)\n",
    "\n",
    "* quant research (model validation)\n",

    "We are assigned a mini-project to create the first prototype using real market data."
